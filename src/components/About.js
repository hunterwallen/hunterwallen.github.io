					I am a full-stack software engineer with a special focus on mobile development that takes pride in delivering clean, scalable solutions. There is nothing in life that brings me more joy than the pursuit of knowledge. I consider myself to forever be a student and find great satisfaction in learning new things.
					<br/> 
					<br/>Outside of coding and developing software, I love the great outdoors. There's nothing like taking in a beautiful sunset from the top of a mountain to refresh the soul.
					<br/>
					<br/>If you have an opportunity you think I would be a good fit for, I would love to chat!
